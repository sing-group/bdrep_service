# STRep Service
This is the service (daemon) which implements the preprocessing of datasets when using STRep (https://github.com/sing-group/strep). This daemon should work in background to execute time-consumming tasks that can not be executed while using STRep web interface.

STRep (and STRep_Service) has been deployed in rdata.4spam.group for testing purposes.
